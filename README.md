Application for cervical cancer prevention through menstrual tracking

**Problem**

Women do not detect cervical cancer early enough to prevent it from becoming fatal


**Solution**

Expanding current apps, like Maya, working to destigmatize women's health.
Changing the app to detect irregularities in women's cycles to then notify them that they should seek medical attention and connect them with additional resources


**Key Metrics**

Analytics of the app will reveal how many times the app has flaged irregularities in individual's cycles and the user engagement with cervical cancer resources
Overtime, there will be a measurable increase in early screenings for cervical cancer


**Resources**

Collaboration with a period tracking app for the user information that currently exists within the app
Cervical cancer research to support the validity of the resources that would be added to the app
Access to cervical cancer prevention programs that exists in other countries to determine how to approach different cultures and geographic locations


**Unique Value Proposition**

Allow users to input symptoms that could indicate early signs of cervical cancer while providing personalized information on reproductive health and directions to nearby clinics or health care practitioners
